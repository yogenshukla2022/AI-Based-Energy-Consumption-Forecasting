Energy consumption forecasting is a critical task for efficient power management and sustainable energy systems. The demand for electricity varies dynamically due to human activities, weather conditions, time of day, and seasonal factors. Accurate forecasting allows utility companies to balance supply and demand, minimize operational costs, and integrate renewable energy sources more effectively.

This project implements an AI-driven forecasting model using Python and TensorFlow. The approach treats energy consumption as a time-series prediction problem, where past usage data is used to predict future demand. We employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly well-suited for capturing sequential dependencies and temporal patterns in data.

The workflow is as follows:

Data Preparation – Load and preprocess historical energy consumption records, including optional exogenous features such as temperature and time-based variables.

Model Training – Train the LSTM model on sliding windows of past energy usage to predict the next time step.

Evaluation – Assess performance using standard metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Prediction – Generate short-term forecasts (e.g., next hour/day) based on recent historical values.

The repository includes scripts for training (train.py), prediction (predict.py), a sample dataset, and a Jupyter notebook for exploratory analysis.

This project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to real-world energy management problems, supporting smarter grids, cost savings, and improved sustainability.
