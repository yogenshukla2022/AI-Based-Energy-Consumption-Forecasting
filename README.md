Electricity is one of the most essential resources in our daily life. From lighting our homes to running industries, everything depends on a reliable supply of power. However, the demand for electricity is never constant. It keeps changing throughout the day and across seasons. For example, in the morning when people prepare for work, energy usage increases. In the afternoon, industrial consumption may rise, while at night, lights, fans, air conditioners, or heaters add to the load.

Power companies face a big challenge: if they produce too much electricity, it leads to wastage and higher costs. If they produce too little, it causes shortages and blackouts. This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a vital role.

In this project, we use AI and Machine Learning techniques to study past energy consumption data along with factors like weather and time. By analyzing these patterns, the AI learns how electricity demand behaves under different conditions. Once trained, the model can predict future energy usage for the coming hours or days.

Such forecasts are very useful for energy providers. They can plan production more efficiently, reduce costs, and avoid unnecessary wastage. Accurate forecasting also supports renewable energy sources like solar and wind, which depend heavily on weather conditions.

In simple terms, this project helps in predicting tomorrowâ€™s electricity needs today, ensuring better management of resources, lower costs, and more reliable power supply.
